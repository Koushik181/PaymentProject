<p class ="lead"> <strong>Live more, Bank less  </strong></p>
<p>
In May 2018, DBS evolved our decade-old positioning “Living, Breathing Asia” to “Live more, Bank less”. This new brand promise reflects our belief that in the digital era, we need to deliver banking that is so simple, seamless and invisible, our customers have more time to spend on the people or things they care about.

It encapsulates several ideas – enabling customers to live hassle-free with invisible banking, to seize life’s opportunities and to live larger than themselves.

<p class ="lead"> <strong>Embedding ourselves in the customer journey</strong></p>
<p>
    
To become more customer-centric, we continued to embed ourselves in the customer journey. Working together with ecosystem partners, DBS has launched digital first propositions providing on-the-go loans, investments and online marketplace to help customers access new markets. The idea was to embed banking in the everyday lives of customers, making banking invisible.
